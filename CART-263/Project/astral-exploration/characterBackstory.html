            <p>Zorg is an alien from the planet Zorgon. One day, while cruising through the galaxy in his slightly
                dented flying saucer, Zorg spotted a weird-looking blue planet. He’d never seen it before on his blurby
                maps (which, to be fair, were upside down). Naturally, he had to investigate.</p>

            <br />

            <p>Unfortunately, Zorg's piloting skills are... questionable. He crash-landed on Earth. Right in the middle
                of what humans call a “parking lot.”<br /><br /> His saucer?<br /> Fried. <br /><br /> His snacks?<br />
                Gone.<br /><br /> His GPS?<br /> Only speaks Zorgish.<br /><br /> Now, stranded and mildly panicked,
                Zorg has no choice but to learn how to communicate with Earthlings. If he ever wants to get back to
                Zorgon (and his snack collection), he'll need to figure out how these strange beings talk, think, and
                live.</p>
