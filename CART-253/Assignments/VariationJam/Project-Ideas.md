# Brainstorm ideas for the main project and the 3 variations of it 

## Main Idea
~~Papa's Pizeria game or cooking simulation game <br/>~~
~~Flappy bird game~~
Smoothie Making Sim

### Variations Brainstorm

#### Smoothie making sim called Smoo Vee's (Chosen idea!)
1. Solids and liquids are in conflict, they hate eachother ever since the blender made an appearance in the kitchen. Quick! MAke the smoothie before they kill eachother. (the food elements are talking/running and causing trouble)
2. Vee isn't really making smoothies, the food elements are people (hints in the ingredient names/smoothie names ex: stawBARRY) they try talking to vee but she ignores the food. As the experience goes on you will hear screams and she will get angrier and more irritated.
~~3. Making smoothies with expires food, there's a weird smell in the store the food looks horrible, drink names are gross and she gets shut down because shes selling trash.~~ I only need two other variations  

#### Flappy Bird
1. inverted game the whole world is upside down
2. mode where the player moves the obstacles and not the bird
3. flappy bird controlled by sound from user's microphone
