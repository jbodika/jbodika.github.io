## Description

A modification of an original game about catching flies made by Pippin Barr.

Frog loves to eat and grows bigger with each meal.</br>
However, Frog can't eat fruit, or it will get a stomach ache.</br>
Frog is also afraid of snakes.</br>
Frog needs to be careful not to eat too much.

### Controls

- Click to launch the tongue.
- As you keep catching flies, you will grow based on the type of fly eaten.
- Once you reach a score of 50, please avoid touching the snake or you will get eaten.
- Avoid eating <ins>any fruits</ins> or else you will lose points based on the fruit eaten.
- If you let a fly go away you will lose a life. 

## In-depth explanation of the point system
- If you eat an Apple (red circle) you lose -3 points.
- If you eat an Orange (orange circle) you lose -5 points.
- If you eat a Watermelon (green circle) you lose -7 points.
