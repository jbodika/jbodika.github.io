# Potential features to implement

1. ~~**Add a scoring system based on the flies caught (assign different points based on the type of fly?)** -> houseflies (1) , fruit flies(3), and crane flies (7)~~
2. ~~**Add items that frogs can't eat (do research)** ->  human food~~
3. ~~**Add a shaking feature to the flies moving around**~~
4. ~~Display the flies falling with the frog's tongue~~ this feature is not very useful and won't be noticible because of the fast motion of the frog's tongue so i will opt out
5. ~~**3 Lives? if the frog misses 3 times the game is over**~~
6. ~~As the frog eats more flies it gets bigger and bigger~~
7. ~~As the game gets harder maybe a snake tries to eat it or when it gets at a certain number like 30?~~
8. ~~**Add sound when flies are caught**~~
9. ~~**Add scoring system**~~
